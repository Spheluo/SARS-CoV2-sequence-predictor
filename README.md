# SARS-CoV2-sequence-predictor

we aimed to predict the sequence evolution of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by using deep learning.
The pipeline, methods and codes here were modified from a flu-forecaster developed by Eric Ma.

The SARS-CoV-2 sequence data come from the NCBI virus database.

Some codes were rewritten so that they can be run on Google Colab.
